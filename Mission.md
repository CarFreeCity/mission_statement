# Mission statement:
Our mission is to design and implement a sustainable, livable urban environment in which cars are no longer the primary means of transportation. We strive to create a city that prioritizes the health and well-being of its citizens, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and protects the natural environment. By embracing innovative uses of existing technologies and urban planning strategies, we aim to create an open source model for car-free city living that can be replicated around the world.

* City size: 500 to 750 acres growing over time to 40,000 to 60,000 residents
* Emphasis on communal spaces that encourage genuine human interactions and personal relationships
* Open source, created by the community and repeatable by others throughout the world

# Features of the car free city:

* No privately owned automobiles allowed within the city limits, though exceptions will be made in the beginning for emergency services (ambulence, fire truck) and certain logistics (moving, delivery), with the long term goal of phasing these vehicles out as better alternatives are devised

* Sufficient density, All areas of city should be accessible by bike or ebike or other last mile vehicle within 15 minutes

* A focus on creating vibrant, livable communities, with a mix of housing, commercial, and recreational spaces that support social interactions and a sense of belonging.

* A well-developed public transportation system, including trains, and other forms of mass transit, that provides reliable and convenient access to all parts of the city.

* An extensive network of bike paths and pedestrian-friendly streets, making it easy and safe for people to walk or bike to their destinations.

* A strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, with buildings and infrastructure designed to minimize their impact on the natural world.

* A commitment to keeping housing affordable to everyone in the community whether they work in a low wage occupation, or otherwise

* Ample community space such as public squares with lots of restaurants and shops

* Space for community resources such as: wood shops, metal shops for people to pursue crafts, or facilitate the ability to repair belongings


# Our plan:

**1: Grow our community online:** through producing articles, social media posts, video content and spreading the word online, our goal is to grow this discord to 1000+ active participating members. 

**2: Found a non-profit organization :** The non-profit organization will be used to fund operations of the project including paying for legal and professional services, drafting architectural plans and other expenses of the project. 

**3: Recruit a high caliber board of trustees :**  The purpose of a non-profit board of directors is to provide oversight, guidance, and support to the organization. The board is responsible for setting the overall direction and strategy of the non-profit, as well as ensuring that it is being managed effectively and achieving its goals. The board typically consists of a group of individuals who are passionate about the non-profit's mission and are committed to supporting its work. These individuals may be chosen for their expertise, experience, or connections, and they may serve on a voluntary or paid basis. The board has a variety of responsibilities, including setting policies, approving budgets, hiring and evaluating the performance of the non-profit's staff, and representing the organization to the public.
